## The Groom: Yuliang Leon Sun

Leon was born in Xiamen, China and followed his parents at the age of 7 to Japan. At the age of 12, Leon moved to the United States only to travel again from west coast to midwest to east coast. From his travels and his voracious appetite, Leon has successfully integrated cuisines from different cultures to generate his original culinary masterpieces. Leon has two dreams, both dedicated to saving people's lives. One is to become a medical doctor and the other is to become a researcher. "Doctors can help thousands of patients directly, while my research may indirectly help millions," says Leon. He is currently working towards achieving both dreams to become a physician scientist through the rigorous training in the 8 year long MD-PhD program at [Boston University School of Medicine](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/). Along his journey, Leon found a role model, [Prof. Darrell Kotton](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/pulmonary/people/faculty/darrellkotton/), and they are working together to cure childhood interstitial lung disease in stem cell derived type II pneumocytes.
