## The Groom: Yuliang Leon Sun

Leon has two dreams, both dedicated to saving people's lives. One is to become a doctor and the other is to become a researcher. "Doctors can help people immediately, while being a researcher gives me the ability to help the mankind in the long run", says Leon. He is currently working towards achieving both dreams with the rigorous training as a MD-PhD student at [Boston University School of Medicine](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/). Along his journey, Leon found a role model, [Prof. Darrell Kotton](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/pulmonary/people/faculty/darrellkotton/), and they are working together to cure childhood interstitial lung disease in iPSC-derived type II pneumocytes.
