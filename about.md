## Yuliang Leon Sun

[Leon Sun](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/kottonlab/files/2017/04/Yuliang_Leon_Sun2.jpg) has two dreams, both dedicated to saving people's lives. One is to become a doctor and the other is to become a researcher. "Doctors can help thousands of patients directly, while my research may indirectly help millions", says Leon. He is currently working towards achieving both dreams to become a physician scientist through the rigorous training in the MD-PhD program at [Boston University School of Medicine](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/). Along his journey, Leon found a role model, [Prof. Darrell Kotton](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/pulmonary/people/faculty/darrellkotton/), and they are working together to cure childhood interstitial lung disease in stem cell derived type II pneumocytes. Before that, Leon graduated with honor from University of Wisconsin-Madison with his B.S. in Biochemistry, mentored by Prof. Aaron Hoskins.
